# CAN-BIND DTI

This repository holds the BASH shell and python source code of programs used to preprocess and analyze the DTI data for the CAN-BIND-1 study. This code was used the produce the manuscript by Davis et al.: "White Matter Indices of Medication Response in Major Depression".

## Installation

The data files and code/script repository typically live in *~/Documents/Research_Projects/CAN-BIND_DTI*. The notes and manuscripts associated with the analysis live in *~/Dropbox/Research_Projects/CAN-BIND_DTI/doc*, and the results live in *~/Dropbox/Research_Projects/CAN-BIND_DTI/group_results*.

To add the bin directory of this project in the typical location to your PATH variable, use:

    export PATH=~/Documents/Research_Projects/CAN-BIND_DTI/bin:"$PATH"
